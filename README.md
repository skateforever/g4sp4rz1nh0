A fork of gr1nch's tool called splitter and changes by me to understand and improve some features.</br>

This is modified copy of Splitter (https://github.com/renergr1nch/splitter) made by Rener Alberto (aka Gr1nch), from DcLabs Security Team.</br>

I'm trying to create a minimum infrastructure to help me during a Black Box Pentest, using a modified splitter version that contemplates setup some VPS's with VPN's and running TOR instances.</br>

Use it for yourself and take responsibility for your actions if you are using it for any criminal act.</br>

If you have any doubts about how it works, go to the splitter page and read the documentation provided there or try to read the code generated here, as it has been modified to make it easier to read and make any modification simpler.</br>
